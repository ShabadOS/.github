# Contributing to Shabad OS for Desktop

Thank you for your interest to participate in Shabad OS projects! There are many ways for people to contribute, beyond writing code or programming, see [Feedback](#feedback) for non-developer contributors. This document is for developers or programmers that wish to write code and directly contribute to the source code of Shabad OS.

## Feedback

There are many ways for people to contribute, beyond writing code or programming:

* Ask a question via [Slack](https://chat.shabados.com)
* Request a new feature or report unexpected bugs by filing an issue
* Upvote popular feature requests using the thumbs-up/+1 reaction on the first post of an issue
* Follow [@shabad_os on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shabad_os/) and [@shabad_os on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/shabad_os/) and let us know what you think!

## Workflow

The general workflow of development is to choose an issue to work on, create a personal branch off `dev` branch, and submit a pull request. This _fork and pull model_ model is shared across all repos in the Shabad OS organization.

:fire: Please see the [shared docs for Workflow](https://github.com/ShabadOS/.github/wiki/How-to-Contribute#workflow) (Issue Tracking, Branching, and Pull Requests) in the wiki.

## Coding Guidelines

Our coding guidelines are also (mostly) shared across all repos in the Shabad OS organization. Aside from scope definitions (which are repo specific), the rest should be referenced in the wiki article.
